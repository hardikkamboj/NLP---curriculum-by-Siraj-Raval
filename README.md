The cirriculum can be found [here](https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn-Natural-Language-Processing-Curriculum)


# Part 1
I started by studying about the basic terminilogy used in NLP, word tokenizing, stop words removal, lemmatization, tokenization etc. The jupyter notebook for that can be found [here](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/NLP---curriculum-by-Siraj-Raval/blob/main/Part_1/project.ipynb). This was the week 1 of the cirriculum. <br>

But then i felt that I needed to study the fundamentals in a more detailed manner, and through ACM learning, I started the book [NLP-fundamentals](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/NLP-Fundamentals-book), which i finished today, 17-01-2021. It took me around 2 months to complete this book. 

# Part 2
Woah, this took a long time. I was going throught the lectures, which were very overwhleming for me. They were a bit advanced as to my current understanding. Then came the final project, which was building HMM using pytorch. I had never used pytorch before. So, went for some turotials from Sentdex. 
After going through the tutorials, when i came back to HMM, it was maths heavy, and i will skip it for now..
