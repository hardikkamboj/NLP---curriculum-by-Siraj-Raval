# Part 1
I started by studying about the basic terminilogy used in NLP, word tokenizing, stop words removal, lemmatization, tokenization etc. The jupyter notebook for that can be found [here](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/NLP---curriculum-by-Siraj-Raval/blob/main/Part_1/project.ipynb). This was the week 1 of the cirriculum. <br>

But then i felt that I needed to study the fundamentals in a more detailed manner, and through ACM learning, I started the book [NLP-fundamentals](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/NLP-Fundamentals-book), which i finished today, 17-01-2021. It took me around 2 months to complete this book.
